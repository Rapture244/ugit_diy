# ü™µ Logging

## üìñ Core logging concepts: levels, loggers, and handlers

Before diving into the module itself, it‚Äôs worth understanding two key ideas that shape how logging is configured and behaves in Python: **numeric log levels** and **logger hierarchy**.

1. **Numeric log levels ‚Äî what, why, when**  
   - Every log level has a **name** and a **numeric value**:  
     `CRITICAL=50`, `ERROR=40`, `WARNING=30`, `INFO=20`, `DEBUG=10`, `NOTSET=0`.  
   - Internally, Python uses the **numeric values** to decide whether to emit a record (‚Äúlog or drop?‚Äù).  
   - Numeric levels become useful when:
     - Writing **structured logs** (e.g., JSON) for better filtering and thresholding in tools.
     - Aggregating logs and computing metrics (e.g., ‚Äú% of ERROR+ over time‚Äù).
     - Implementing custom filters (e.g., ‚Äúdrop anything `< 25`‚Äù).
     - In human-readable logs, you don‚Äôt typically display the numeric level. But in structured logs, including a `levelno` field is best practice.  
     üëâ TL;DR ‚Äî Keep your text formatters as-is. If you adopt JSON logs later, add `levelno` to the object.

2. **Root logger vs package loggers ‚Äî handler strategy**  
   - A clean and scalable setup is a **hybrid model**:
     - Set the **root logger** to `WARNING` to silence most 3rd-party noise.
     - Set your **package logger** (e.g., `ugit_diy`) to `DEBUG` with `propagate=True` and **no handlers**.
     - Attach handlers only to the **root logger**.
   - Result:
     - Console output stays clean (shows INFO+ from your package).
     - Full detail is still captured in log files.
     - 3rd-party libraries remain quiet unless they log WARNING+.

## üì¶ Module overview: `logging_setup.py`

This module is the **centralized logging bootstrap** for the whole project. Its job is to ensure logging is configured consistently, predictably, and safely across all environments ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre running the CLI, tests, or library code.

Here are the big ideas behind its design and behavior:

1. **One source of truth: packaged `dictConfig`**  
   - A structured JSON config file ships **inside the package**.  
   - At startup, the module **loads and applies that config** with `logging.config.dictConfig`.  
   - It **never accepts external paths from the environment**, preventing config drift and ensuring reproducibility.

2. **Normalize all file outputs to `<REPO_ROOT>/logs`**  
   - Any file-based handler is rewritten so it logs into a `logs/` directory **under the repository root** (found by walking upward until `pyproject.toml` is discovered).  
   - Only the **basename** is preserved.  
   - This guarantees logs always end up in a predictable place, regardless of what the packaged config said.

3. **Environment-level override: `UGIT_LOG_LEVEL`**  
   - Even if the dictConfig defines levels, the **root logger** can be bumped globally via `UGIT_LOG_LEVEL`.  
   - Applied *after* config load, it acts as a final override ‚Äî ideal for debugging or CI without touching config files.

4. **Fail fast, fail safe**  
   - The resource path tuple is validated at import time. If malformed, it raises immediately.  
   - If the packaged config is missing or invalid, it **falls back** to a minimal `basicConfig` setup with an ISO-style timestamp.  
   - A warning is logged, but the process never crashes ‚Äî logging must never silently fail.

5. **Emit boot warnings *after* handlers exist**  
   - Any warnings gathered during setup are emitted **only after** a handler is configured.  
   - This ensures they‚Äôre properly logged and visible in your logs and tests.

## üß™ Pytest overview

Tests for `ugit_diy.logging_setup` validate that logging behaves predictably and robustly across all scenarios ‚Äî missing configs, environment overrides, fake repos, etc. They aim to ensure logging is **reliable, isolated, and reproducible**.

1. **Global state isolation**  
   - `_reset_logging_state` fixture clears handlers, resets the root logger, and disables warnings capture before and after each test.  
   - Prevents state leakage between tests, which is crucial because logging is global.

2. **Fake repo roots for predictable paths**  
   - `tmp_logs_dir` fixture creates a temporary fake repo with a `pyproject.toml`, patches `_discover_repo_root()` to return it, clears `_ensure_repo_logs_dir`‚Äôs cache, and returns `<repo>/logs`.  
   - This allows deterministic verification of path rewriting logic.

3. **Handler path normalization**  
   - `test_apply_repo_local_filename_basename_only` checks that `_apply_repo_local_filename` rewrites all file-handler paths into `<logs_dir>/<basename>` while ignoring non-file handlers.

4. **Fallback behavior**  
   - `test_setup_logging_fallback_when_packaged_missing` ensures the module falls back to `basicConfig` when no packaged config exists, sets the root logger to `INFO`, and emits a warning.  
   - `test_setup_logging_fallback_respects_env_level` verifies that `UGIT_LOG_LEVEL` still overrides the root level even in fallback mode.

5. **Packaged configuration and path rewrite**  
   - `test_setup_logging_applies_packaged_and_rewrites_paths` confirms that packaged `dictConfig` is applied, file paths are normalized into `<REPO_ROOT>/logs`, and log files are created.  
   - `test_setup_logging_packaged_level_override_with_env` verifies that `UGIT_LOG_LEVEL` overrides the root logger level even when a packaged config is present.

6. **Utility behavior**  
   - `test_get_logs_dir_creates_and_returns_repo_logs` checks that `get_logs_dir()` returns the canonical logs directory, ensures it exists, and matches the expected path.
